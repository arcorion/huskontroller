"# Huskontroller" 

## Introduction
This is a touch panel user interface for the University of Washington AV systems, designed to control our AV stack including Extron switchers and Panasonic projectors. It is largely a rush job, but fits our basic needs.

## Build
The interface relies heavily on Kivy and pySerial, which are necessary to run the software.
